1. 真实条件句：实现的可能性非常大，在条件句中常用现在某种时态表将来时态。If you <span style="background:#fff88f">love</span> it, you <span style="background:#fff88f">can keep</span> it to yourself.如果你喜欢，你就可以留给自己
2. 虚拟条件句：不能实现或纯假想的情况，可以对过去、现在或将来进行假想，分别用不同的动词形式表示。


|     | 状语从句                  | 主语从句              |
| --- | --------------------- | ----------------- |
| 对现在 | did/were              | w,s,c,m+do        |
| 对过去 | had done              | w,s,c,m+have done |
| 对未来 | should+do, were to do | w,s,c,m+do        |

::: tip
    would/should表示“会”

    would用于各人称

    should 用于第一人称

    could表示“能够”

    might表示“有可能”

    从句的谓语决定主句的时态

    <font color="#6425d0">在虚拟语气中，无论是第几人称，be动词的过去式都只用were，</font>

1. 对现在的虚拟（表示对现在不可能实现的情况的假想）
    - If i knew her number, i ==would call== her.（事实是我不知道她的号码）
    - If i had the money, I ==could buy== the car. （事实是我沒有钱）
2. 对过去的虚拟
    - If I had studied hard, I could ==have passed== the test.
    - If I had known her number, I ==would have called== her.
3. 对将来的虚拟
    - If we ==should come== tomorrow, we ==could meet== him.
    ::: tip
    should + 动词原形   可能性最大
    动词过去式              可能性次之
    wereto +动词原形   可能性最小

::: danger **省略if的情况**

if引导的虚拟条件中含有were,had,should时,可将If去掉然后把were,had,should置于句首（只有were, had,should能倒装到句首）
- If **should** meet her, I would tell her.
    = **Should** I meet her, I would tell her.  如果我见到她，我会告诉她的。
-  If i **were** in your position, I would do it better. 
    = **Were** I in your position, I would do it better.  如果我在你的位置，我会做得更好。
- 注意：If had enough money, I would buy a car.此时had为实义动词，不可倒装，If不能省略。

> [!summary] 虚拟语气had开头
> 虚拟语气中if条件句中如果有had，那么可以省略if，然后把had提前。直接把had翻译成**如果**。
> - Ka­ reem Adeem, the head of the water depart­ ment, says that ==had== it not been for covid­19，the project **would** have gone even faster.
> =if it had not been for covid­19，the project would have gone even faster.如果这个项目不是因为意外疫情，可能已经完成了甚至更快
> - she says that, had Newark residents not protested and had she not ﬁled suit, Mr Baraka would not have acted as he did. 
> - 如果Newark州的居民不抗议的话并且如果她没有提交诉讼的话，那么Mr Baraka不可能已经行动，正如他之前做的一样
> - 她说，如果纽瓦克居民没有抗议，如果她没有提起诉讼，巴拉卡先生就不会像他那样行事。

::: warning 条件状语从句与虚拟语气
1. If it rains tomorrow, I will stay at home.（陈述语气条件句）
2. f it were to rain tomorrow, I would stay at home.（虚拟语气将来时）
- 两个句子的意思都是“如果明天下雨我就呆在家里。”但是有细微差别：句子1表示下雨的几率是50%。句子2用were to的虚拟语气将来时假设在100多年都没下过雨的沙漠上，下雨的可能性是0。

::: danger **1244**
- 一主张：insist
- 二命令：command、order
- 四建议：suggest、advise、propose、recommend
- 四要求：ask、require、request、demand
- 当以上这些动词引导宾语从匆时，从句中谓语动词用should +动词原形（被动语态用should+be+过去分词）一般should 可省略。
- My mother suggested that we (should) do the job at once.
- The suggestion that the sports meet (should) be put off was rejected.
- （1）当以上动词的派生词出现时，都要用虚拟。
- （2）有标志词时，从句一般选suggestion, advice, proposal, recommendation
