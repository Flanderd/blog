**本质还是状语（adv）来形容adj和v**
1. 关系连词+分句，主谓宾。（主谓宾，关系连词+分句）注意有时候没有逗号分开
2.当分句主语与主句主语一致时可以省略分句主语，如果分句中含有Be动词则be动词也可以省略。
    When I am happy, I can play soccer.	只有我开心的时候我可以踢足球。
    When happy, I can play soccer. = I can play soccer, When I am happy.	
3. 如果没有省略，可以选择其中一个作为代词。
    - A history of long and effortless success can be a dreadful handicap, but if properly handled, it may become a driving force.
    - When the United States entered just such a glowing period after the end of the second world war, it had a market eight times larger than any competitor, giving its industries unparalleled economies of scale.
4. 有时候副词放在不同位置，但本质还是修饰V
    e.g.：I like playing soccer, however.
        however, I like playing soccer.
        I , however, like playing soccer.
