# 第六周 非谓语动词

1. 本质的逻辑

   - 主谓宾，再想出现谓语

   - 非谓语也是需要主语的

   - 谓语 and 谓语
     - I am happy, feeling wonderful.

   - 主谓宾，doing sth。 先发生，后doing
     - Finishing reading this book, I become smarter. 先读书，后聪明 
     - Finishing watching this movie, I am feeling happy.先看电影，后开心

   - Doing开头，要么动名词要么非谓语（后面的主语发出）

   - Done开头一定是非谓语
     - Written by this author, this book is good.

2. 语法规则

   1. 没有逗号——大部分修饰前面的名词
   
      - There is a book including some info.
   
      - There is a book written by him.
   
        特例——修饰前面的主语或前面的一句话/一事情
   
      - This accident happened yesterday making me scared.
   
      - There is a book of history including many pages. 具体问题具体分析，可以修饰book或者history。
   
   2. 有逗号——修饰前面的名词、主语、前面一句话/一件事
   
      - I have a book, making me happy. 可以book或者这个事情。
      - I just finished my homework, feeling happy. 
      - Reading books makes me understand math better, confusing me a lot. 
   
   3. 在句中出现——看能不能发出这个关系
   
      - The study published by 某机构
      
      原先是be done
      注意区分be doing是进行时。
      
      如果出现 the study doing 一定是非谓语

      - 想要写的作文比较高级和地道：主语 定语 谓语 宾语
